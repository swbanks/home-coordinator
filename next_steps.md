# Next Steps

1. Password protect the parent login (do not need a username)
1. Method for "get today's chore status for user" - returns chore and status
1. Use dropdown for Child login instead of text field
1. Add/remove chores that I want them to do
    - cubbies
    - turning laundry inside out
    - remove memory verse
    - what else?
1. Allow the parent view to have the date associated with it
1. Being able to navigate to the next and previous day in a single month
1. Create some utility functions - figure out what I would want these to be
1. Navigation to the correct page 
1. Need a loader for png files because of the background image
1. Get background image working
1. Add interface where we can show how much time they have on devices, check for if they did chores w/o being told, more info they can add, etc


# Different Tech

1. Consider using Redux for state management so I can use the back button and load the proper state each time
1. Attempt to use GraphQL for one request
1. Add Typescript to the mix
1. Add some unit testing to the front end and back end
1. Start to add very minimal E2E testing using Cypress

# Later

1. Calculate allowance based on them checking off their chores (and getting checked by parents)
1. List of other things to check for the day, like if we had to ask them to do chores, games before chores, if they ate fruit, how much they purchased at school, etc.
